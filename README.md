# mechanical-turtle
Imagine a mechanical turtle that walks around the room under the control of a C# app.
The turtle holds a pen in one of two positions—up or down.
While the pen is down, the turtle traces out shapes as it moves, and while the pen is up, the turtle moves about freely without writing anything.
In this problem, you’ll simulate the operation of the turtle and create a computerized sketchpad.
Use a 20-by-20 rectangular array floor that’s initialized to 0.
Read commands from an array that contains them.
Keep track at all times of the current position of the turtle and whether the pen is currently up or down.
Assume that the turtle always starts at position (0, 0) of the floor with its pen up and move to the right by default.
